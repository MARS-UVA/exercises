1. (test-driven development) Oh no! Someone wrote a whole load of spaghetti code for our MaxFinder class. It looks like it's passing our 1 unit test, but I'm suspicious of it. 
    - Write tests in the Main class until you find an error.
    - Fix the bug. Only 1 line should be changed.
    - Document the max method so people can understand what it does.
    - Fix the code as much as possible to make it clean and consistent, while maintaining the same behavior (refactoring).
